# Automatey

Automatey aims to get you quickly set up with a RHEL 7 server running a bunch of useful
automation tools as docker containers. It assumes you've got a reasonable RHEL 7 build
that's registered with subscription-manager. The build I'm working on has also been 
hardened to CIS 2.2 standards.

## Setup

After cloning the repo...

```
cd automatey
./1-packages.sh 

```
